# co-author_link_prediction_V2

This is a python code for implementing link prediction based on extr author node-based features extracted from two huge academic co-authorship networks datasets that are publicly available:

1-ArnetMiner

2-DBLP

Each co-authorship network is presented as the largest connected components graph. The graph is generated by running the R code in largest_connected_component.R script in New_EXP_ArnetMiner_lcc folder for ArnetMiner network and New_EXP_dblp_lcc folder for DBLP network. 

The author node-based features includes features extracted for each author pair on co-authorship network. Those features include the features extracted by computing the similarity of research interest (implemented in rs_ similarity.R) between two authors, the similarity of their affiliations (implemented in aff_ similarity.R), the sum of their research performance indices (implemented in main.py), and the similarity between the two nodes representing both authors on the graph of co-authorship network (implemented in largest_connected_component.R).  For extracting similarity of research interests and affiliations of two authors in addition to the sum of their research performance indices, the author information available at AMiner_Author.txt is needed. 

To run our proposed link prediction approach, the user must run the following command from either New_EXP_ArnetMiner_lcc or New_EXP_dblp_lcc working directories:

Python main.py
