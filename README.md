# co-author_link_prediction_V2

This is a python code for implementing link prediction based on author content-based features in two large subsets of the two huge academic co-authorship networks datasets that are publicly available:

1-ArnetMiner

2-DBLP

Each co-authorship network is presented as the largest connected components graph. The graph is generated by running the R code in largest_connected_component.R script in New_EXP_ArnetMiner_lcc folder for ArnetMiner network and New_EXP_dblp_lcc folder for DBLP network. The code generates topological features for this graph. Those features are used to compare the performance results of our proposed link prediction approach that uses author content-based features to the link prediction approach based on topological network features. The authorâ€™s content-based features includes features extracted from computing the similarity of research interest (implemented in rs_similarity.R) and affiliation (implemented in aff_similarity.R) of each author pair on academic co-authorship network graph in addition to the features that aggregates  the research performance indices of each author pair (implemented in main.py).  For extracting those type of feature, the author information available at AMiner_Author.txt is needed.
