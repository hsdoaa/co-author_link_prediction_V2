# co-author_link_prediction_V2

This is a python code for implementing link prediction in two public available cauthorship networks datasets:

1-ArnetMiner

2-dblp

Each cauthorship network is presented as the largest connected components graph. The graph is generated by running the R code in largest_connected_component.R script that
generates topological features for this graph. Those features in addition to other features that are extracted from author network (AMiner_Author.txt) in case of dblp dataset or 
AMiner_Author_330000.txt in case of ArnetMiner dataset are used to train machine larning classifers that predict links between co-authors in each cauthorship network.
